My name is Zachary Martin. I've recently graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a B.S. Physics and B.S. Maths degree, and will be joining a Ph.D. Physics program at the University of Chicago starting next Fall.

My research focus is on particle astrophysics, and in particular, ultra high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos - it has been with the ANITA and now, PUEO experiments. It has been focused on instrumentation and computational physics including Monte Carlo simulations, data analysis, and tools such as Geant4, ROOT, and Pythia. In my free time, I took an online course in data science. While not formal, I understand the main concepts; I only have not been able to apply this to any real-world projects, so this would be a perfect opportunity. I've touched on TensorFlow, but not on PyTorch or fastai. But I'm confident with my experience in Python that I can pick these up quick enough, alongside any other tools/packages I may need to succeed with this project.

Of the projects that interest me, this is definitely my favorite. I understand the importance of trigger systems and can really appreciate figuring out how to efficiently keep the interesting data. Using deep learning methods to solve this sounds really promising. I would love to help see this to fruition, or at the very least, iron-out some of the difficulties in the way!
